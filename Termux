# Running OpenClaw in Termux proot-distro debian

## Overview
This is a quick sharing of the catches when installing OpenClaw in proot debian.

**Important Notes:**
- Alpine won't work because @mariozechner/clipboard native plugin does not have linux arm64 musl version
- Device Used: Asus ROG phone 9 pro edition (SD 8 Elite, 24GB RAM)
- Installation is done in a separate App running proot using the Termux proot binary

## Limitations
Unfortunately, running a local model on the phone is not feasible. Running a model as an agent requires 10x the power compared to chatting. Currently only using Gemini API for this guide.

## Dependencies

### Recommended Tools
- **fish** shell: Better auto-completions and command validation
- **micro** editor: For viewing files

### DNS Configuration
Make sure you can run `apt update` properly. If not, use:

```bash
printf "nameserver 8.8.8.8\nnameserver 1.1.1.1">/etc/resolv.conf

Running OpenClaw in Termux proot-distro debian
General

This is a quick sharing of the catches when installing OpenClaw in proot debian.

Alpine won't work because @mariozechner/clipboard native plugin does not have linux arm64 musl version

I'm using Asus ROG phone 9 pro edition: SD 8 Elite, 24GB RAM

I installed it in a separate App of mine running proot using the Termux proot binary so it should be roughly the same.

Unfortunately I haven't been able to run this by a local model on my phone. I've set up Ollama but running a model as an agent requires like 10 times the power as compared with only chatting with it due to a large prompt by many tools. Now only showcasing using Gemini API.

Dependencies
I recommend using fish as the shell for its out-of-the-box auto-completions and also a quick checker if the command you're going to run exists(red if not exist)

I personally use micro to view files

make sure you can run apt update properly, if not use:

printf "nameserver 8.8.8.8\nnameserver 1.1.1.1">/etc/resolv.conf

then

apt install curl git cmake build-essential zstd unzip

Installing Node.js and Bun
I haven't tried installing directly by Bun so I'm currently installing using npm and then run: bun $(which openclaw)

The reason of using Bun is that if you run openclaw by node it's just too slow. Even if it's only openclaw --help, it takes a very long time even on my 8 Elite.

Node.js
Use the official script from here

I run it by using micro inode.sh to save it to a file and then sh inode.sh

After installing you don't automatically get it in your $PATH so you need to do sth like this on every login:

export PATH="/root/versions/node/v25.5.0/bin:$PATH"

Bun
Use the official script:

curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

After installing it will prompt you to also export to $PATH manually on every login

export BUN_INSTALL="$HOME/.bun"

export PATH="$BUN_INSTALL/bin:$PATH"

Installing by npm and patching it
npm i -g openclaw

In the process it seems like it builds some kind of llama.cpp in the background so it will take a very long time

After installing don't rush into running that openclaw command directly. Some patches are needed for it to work properly

To be specific, you have to patch os.networkInterfaces() : directly give it a static value

In my case I chose to do:

Under native Termux, switch to the root's home folder of your proot debian:

cd $PREFIX/var/lib/proot-distro/installed-rootfs/debian/root

node -e 'fs.writeFileSync("./ni.json",JSON.stringify(os.networkInterfaces()))'

And then for each file needing the patch read file and return JSON.parse

I currently found 3 files to be patched under ~/versions/node/v25.5.0/lib/node_modules:

openclaw/dist/infra/system-presence.js

openclaw/dist/infra/tailnet.js

openclaw/node_modules/@homebridge/ciao/lib/NetworkManager.js

For the first two files, add to the beginning:

import fs from "node:fs";

And search for os.networkInterfaces() and replace with:

JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('/root/ni.json').toString())

For the 3rd file search for os_1.default.networkInterfaces() and replace with:

JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('/root/ni.json').toString())

Running OpenClaw & authenticating by Gemini CLI
Install Gemini CLI
npm i -g @google/gemini-cli

Ensure xdg-open
Then make sure xdg-open is able to open a browser window to authenticate properly.

You can first install a GUI or do some tricks like this:

mv /usr/bin/xdg-open /usr/bin/xdg-open.bak

printf '#!/bin/sh\necho "$@">>/data/data/com.termux/files/home/authurl.txt'>/usr/bin/xdg-open

chmod +x /usr/bin/xdg-open

remember to restore xdg-open if needed after authentication

Running onboard
bun $(which openclaw) onboard

this will guide you through setting up Gemini API as the provider.

If you did the trick mentioned above to xdg-open, open a separate Termux tab and:

cat authurl.txt

to look for the url to open manually

Get the access token
In proot debian

micro ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json

look for gateway.auth.token and copy it

Running gateway(WebUI server)
bun $(which openclaw) gateway &

Open in the browser http://localhost:18789

Paste the auth token in the prev section and start your journey

Be careful about isolation though

I would recommend using:

pd login --isolated debian

before actually running the gateway

If you want graphical Apps to work, run in Termux native:

termux-x11 :0 -listen tcp -ac &

export DISPLAY=:0

LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 xfwm4 &

And then run X11 over TCP in proot by:

export DISPLAY=:0

konsole or some other app

Edit: Browser automation
https://youtube.com/shorts/EsimoncQJw8?si=d-NA0Rkl5nqPttYy

Unfortunately, this function needs to be run by Node.js and not Bun for the gateway

also needs a patch to openclaw/dist/pw-ai-*.js

hardcode a:

const endpoint = "http://127.0.0.1:18791" ; //

as the endpoint for connectOverCDP

.

In the OpenClaw config -> browser,

I've turned on No Sandbox and Browser Evaluate Enabled

Set the default profile to openclaw

Set cdp url to the endpoint above

.

open a test browser window first by:

openclaw browser --browser-profile=openclaw open https://reddit.com

then test automation function first by:

openclaw browser --browser-profile=openclaw snapshot --efficient

Ollama is bloat, ditch it.

Llama cpp is lighter & faster but I guess it will still require the extra power which a phone cannot afford on top of OpenClaw proot.

I don't think we can blame ollama for this one. The method of OpenClaw calling it is via http://localhost:11434/v1 endpoint. I'm running ollama in Termux native so there's no proot overhead there. If you run the exact same model by "ollama run" it is pretty fast and feeling as snappy as llama-cli. The problem is just that as an agent OpenClaw calls the api by lots of structured JSON tools and functions for the model to utilize. Thus expanding every single prompt to at least 11k.

OpenClaw has many options for AI providers. Just run onboard and follow the steps. I'm currently using GPT-5.2-codex for browser automation.

Why does PRoot Distro offer the 'oldstable' version of Debian (i.e. Debian 11 Bullseye)? Is it for maintaining backwards compatibility to support certain applications, or has a different use case where latest version leads to conflicts/problems?
